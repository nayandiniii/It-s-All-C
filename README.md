#C Data Structures Repository
This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the implementation and use of various data structures, both linear and non-linear. The programs range from simple examples to more complex programs that demonstrate advanced features such as dynamic memory allocation and sorting algorithms.

Whether you're a student, educator, or programmer, this repository can help you to gain practical, hands-on experience with data structures in C. The programs in this repository cover a range of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
